# An-IoT-based-Mini-Aquarium-System
IoT enabled system called “Fins And Things” that utilizes various sensors to drive the actuators in real time. The main focus is to implement a mini-aquarium system that is automated, both in terms of lighting and monitoring various physic-chemical parameters using sensors such as LDR(Light Dependent Resistor),Water level and DS18B20(Water temperature).These parameters are further used to actuate water heater, fan, water pump (Hero water HR2 24DC) and light in accordance with threshold. Further automatic fish feeding mechanism is implemented using servo motor.
Our solution lets the user to quickly deploy intelligent control for various water conditions. Aquarium hobbyists can get to know about their pet fish remotely by transferring the data from sensors to Arduino IoT Cloud application.
